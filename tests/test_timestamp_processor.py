"""Regression tests for TimestampProcessor.

These lock in fixes for three timing bugs that shipped in the default paths:
  * minimal mode emitted overlapping subtitles (fast dialogue)
  * "off" mode truncated a segment below its acoustic end via a neighbour's lead-in
  * sentence splitting without word timestamps overflowed the parent span
    (and produced negative-duration segments)

The module is pure/functional and has no heavy dependencies, so these run
without ffmpeg / torch / whisper.
