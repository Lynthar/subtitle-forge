"""Model auto-selection tests.

Locks in the tie-break: large-v3 and large-v2 both claim 6000MB, and
select_optimal_model picks the first survivor of a stable sort — with the
table ordered the other way round, every sufficiently large GPU recommended
the older large-v2 and silently downgraded users from the configured default.

No GPU or model download: get_available_vram is patched. The transcriber
module does pull in faster_whisper though, so skip rather than break the
"tests run without torch/whisper installed" contract the guide documents.
